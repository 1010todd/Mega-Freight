	description "A tugboat from early days of space trading made to transport cargo containers between ground and space when repulsor engines are still in its infancy and many ships from previous era still lack one or were not designed to enter atmosphere and land at all. With more freighters equipped with repulsor engines these tugboat roles changed to assisting these large and cumbersome ships to land, not unlike their sea-bound ancestor."

	description "Bluewhale is a massive freighter for hauling large amount of cargo across the galaxy. Due to its' cost these ship are often owned by freight companies rather than individuals. While it's capable of carrying much more cargo than most other freighters, one of the major complaint received from captains is that it can take very long to reach the innermost container."

	description "Conveyor is a massive freighter designed and build by Freight Galactic with special mechanism for quickly unloading cargo independent of port equipment and extra ports for resupplying theoretically allowing them to trade much faster than ships of similar size. In practice this is debatable as few ports can keep up with the calculations due to various other factors."
	description `Conveyor is also capable of carrying a small squadron of fighters to protect itself, due to number of fighters carried almost matching entire capacity of the Navy Carrier there were attempts to have it restricted yet the CEO of the company simply told them to come get an actual carrier. It is rumoured the company is now developing new carrier for the navy.`

	description `Republic Navy Spetum Class Fleetcarrier is a massive carrier that doubles as mobile headquarter projecting power not only within the system but also to nearby systems. Spetum Class is the first spaceship to carry a complement of fighters on par with wet navy carriers of 20th century. With over 5 times more capacity than older carrier fleets appearance of a single Spetum Class can turn the tide of a battle.`
	description `Public reaction was mixed, while the ship itself it a feat of engineering and a mark of progress in a way some thought the budget could've been better spent else where. Though the ship will be a major deterrence against pirates some where also concerned about the lives of fighter pilots who where often just cannon fodder. Nevertheless armchair generals where all at least somewhat satisfied with what they would consider an actual carrier.`
